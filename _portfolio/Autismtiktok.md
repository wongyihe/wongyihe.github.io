# Introduction

This study aims to examine the ways in which individuals with autism use TikTok to share their experiences, advocate for autism awareness, and increase their reach through hashtags. While there are many autistic creators on TikTok, there is limited research on how they engage with the platform. By analyzing publicly available videos and conducting an in-depth analysis of scraped videos, this research hopes to shed light on how autistic creators use TikTok to express themselves and promote their message. This work is ongoing and may provide valuable insight for future research on the use of TikTok by autistic creators.
