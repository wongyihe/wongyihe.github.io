# Introduction

The purpose of this study is to investigate how individuals with autism utilize TikTok to share their experiences, raise awareness for autism, and expand their reach through hashtags. Despite the presence of numerous autistic creators on TikTok, there is limited research on their engagement with the platform. Through analyzing publicly accessible videos and conducting a thorough analysis of scraped videos, this study aims to shed light on how autistic creators utilize TikTok to communicate and advance their cause. This research project is ongoing and has the potential to provide useful information for future studies on TikTok use by autistic creators.
