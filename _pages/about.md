Hello! This is Yihe. I am a Ph.D. student in [Computational Media](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media/) at Baskin School of Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz. I am advised by [Dr. Kate Ringland](https://kateringland.com/) under [Misfit Lab](https://www.misfit-lab.com/).

My work and research
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction, critical disability studies, sociotechnical systems, and digital accessibility. I am particularly passionate about advancing our understanding of critical disability issues, with a focus on neurodivergent individuals and those on the autism spectrum. 


My background and history
======
I received my M.S. from the [Human-Computer Interaction](https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/) program at University College London, UK, and my B.S. from the Department of [Information Communication](http://www.infocom.yzu.edu.tw/index.php/en/information-2) at Yuan Ze University, Taiwan. Before starting my PhD at UCSC, I spent a year as a media designer at [yU+co.\[lab\]](https://www.yucolab.com/en/home/) Shanghai division, working with multimedia artist [Ng Tsz Kwan](https://shufflingspaceandtime.wordpress.com/ng-tsz-kwan-hk/). To seek my interest in research, I then went to Duke Kunshan University, China, worked with [Dr. Xin Tong](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/xin.tong) as a full-time HCI research assistant.
