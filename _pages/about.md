I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Computational Media](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media/) at Baskin School of Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz. I am advised by [Dr. Kate Ringland](https://kateringland.com/) under [Misfit Lab](https://www.misfit-lab.com/).

My work and research
======
 My research interests lie in the field of human-computer interaction, with a focus on neurodiversity and digital accessibility.


My background and history

I received my M.S. from the [Human-Computer Interaction](https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/) program at University College London, UK, and my B.S. from the Department of [Information Communication](http://www.infocom.yzu.edu.tw/index.php/en/information-2) at Yuan Ze University, Taiwan. Before joined UCSC as a PhD student, I worked with [Dr. Xin Tong](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/xin.tong) at Duke Kunshan University, China, as a full-time research assistant.
