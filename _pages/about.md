I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the Department of [Computational Media](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media/). I am advised by [Dr. Kate Ringland](https://kateringland.com/) under the [Misfit Lab](https://www.misfit-lab.com/).

My work and research
======
My research interests are in human-computer interaction with a focus on neurodiversity and digital accessibility. I use qualitative methods such as interviews and netnography to explore underlying issues, and am working to build quantitative studies to evaluate my prototype designs.


My background and history
======
I received my M.S. from the [Human-Computer Interaction](https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/) program at University College London, UK, and my B.S. from the Department of [Information Communication](http://www.infocom.yzu.edu.tw/index.php/en/information-2) at Yuan Ze University, Taiwan. Before joined UCSC as a PhD student, I worked with [Dr. Xin Tong](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/xin.tong) at Duke Kunshan University, China, as a graduate research assistant.
