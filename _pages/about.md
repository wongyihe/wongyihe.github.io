Hello! This is Yihe. I am a Ph.D. student in [Computational Media](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media/) at Baskin School of Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz. I am advised by [Dr. Kate Ringland](https://kateringland.com/) under [Misfit Lab](https://www.misfit-lab.com/).

My work and research
======
My work takes a critical technical approach to Human-Computer Interaction, examining how computational agents mediate group communication and dynamics. I am currently designing and studying multi-user, context-aware chatbots to understand how they can facilitate or hinder teamwork and relationships. My past research centers neurodivergent perspectives and critically interrogates the values embedded in sociotechnical systems, aiming to support care, agency, and more accountable forms of interaction.


My background and history
======
I received my M.S. from the [Human-Computer Interaction](https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/) program at University College London, UK, and my B.S. from the Department of [Information Communication](http://www.infocom.yzu.edu.tw/index.php/en/information-2) at Yuan Ze University, Taiwan. Before starting my PhD at UCSC, I spent a year as a media designer at [yU+co.\[lab\]](https://www.yucolab.com/en/home/) Shanghai division, working with multimedia artist [Ng Tsz Kwan](https://shufflingspaceandtime.wordpress.com/ng-tsz-kwan-hk/). To seek my interest in research, I then went to Duke Kunshan University, China, worked with [Dr. Xin Tong](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/xin.tong) as a full-time HCI research assistant.
