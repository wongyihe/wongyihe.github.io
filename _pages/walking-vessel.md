##  Background
I am Yihe æ˜“å’Œ, and my name is pronounced as "ee-her", which is the same pronunciation as the Chinese word "ä¸€ç›’", meaning "a box". Therefore, I consider myself a "walking vessel", collecting and carrying the memories and experiences from the exciting places I have lived and the interesting people I have met.

I grew up in [Wenzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenzhou), Zhejiang, a small coastal city in southeastern China. Because Wenzhou is geographically isolated, surrounded by mountains and sea, [Wenzhou dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenzhounese) is difficult to be understood by outsiders. My name is pronounced as Eve in Wenzhounese. So please call me Eve; it makes me feel very close!

My twin sister (yes, we are twins), Yizhi æ˜“çŸ¥, is a talented [ceramic artist](https://www.instagram.com/wangyizhi0924/) who lives in Tokyo, Japan. We place great importance on supporting new artists in the early stages of their careers!

| Great news! After three years of separation due to the COVID pandemic, we finally meet! | Little Yizhi and me. Guess which one is me? | Yizhi's ceramic works are going to be exhibited in Tokyo! |

## Â Love traveling and enjoy the diversity

Initially, I thought I was traveling to discover the places that resonated most with me, but then I realized that I just appreciated the variety of experiences and enjoyed the diversity. Now, when I move to a new place, the question is no longer how to better fit in, but how to better enjoy the difference it offers.
